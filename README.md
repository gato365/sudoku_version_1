Unorganized Thoughts:

1\. Only use a data frame to organize the Sudoku board

2\. There are two different data frames to display the Sudoku board

-   A. Wide: this is the actual physical representation of the Sudoku board Below - 8/26/2022

-   B. Long: turn wide into Long - 8/27/2022

3.  We're going to define a random Sudoku bored by randomly generating numbers to be in the top left square then determine the top right square then determine the bottom left square then systematically determine the bottom right square.
